# Diabetes-Patients

## Dataset

the dataset contains the following columns:
**Pregnancies**: This column records the number of times a patient has been pregnant.

**Glucose**: It represents the patient's plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours during an oral glucose tolerance test. This measurement is an important indicator of blood sugar levels.

**BloodPressure**: This column records the diastolic blood pressure of the patient in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats.

**SkinThickness**: It measures the triceps skin fold thickness in millimeters, which is an indicator of body fat percentage and can be a relevant factor in diabetes diagnosis.

**Insulin**: This column contains the 2-hour serum insulin levels, which can help assess insulin resistance or production in the patient.

**BMI**:(Body Mass Index) BMI is a measure of body fat based on a patient's weight and height. It is calculated using the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/mÂ²).

**DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: This is a function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history. It provides a measure of the genetic influence on diabetes risk.

**Age**: This column records the patient's age in years. Age can be an important factor in understanding diabetes risk as it tends to increase with age.
**Outcome**: The "Outcome" column is a class variable with two values:
       0: This indicates the absence of diabetes in the patient.
       1: This indicates the presence of diabetes in the patient.


## Objectifs

The primary aim of this dataset is to use diagnostic measurements included in it to predict, with a diagnostic approach, whether a patient has diabetes or not.


## Steps
In this project, we will proceed through the following steps:

**Data Loading**: Begin by importing essential libraries and loading the dataset to gain an understanding of its structure and contents.

**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)**: This step includes tasks like checking for distributions and correlations. It helps you uncover insights and anomalies within the dataset.

**Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for analysis and modeling by performing necessary cleaning and handling missing values. 

**Model Development**: This step involves building and training our models.

**Model Evaluation**: After our models are trained, we'll assess their performance by testing them on a separate test dataset.
