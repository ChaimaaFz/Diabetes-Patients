# Diabetes-Patients

**Dataset**
the dataset contains the following columns:
Pregnancies: This column records the number of times a patient has been pregnant.
Glucose: It represents the patient's plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours during an oral glucose tolerance test. This measurement is an important indicator of blood sugar levels.
Blood Pressure: This column records the diastolic blood pressure of the patient in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats.
Skin Thickness: It measures the triceps skin fold thickness in millimeters, which is an indicator of body fat percentage and can be a relevant factor in diabetes diagnosis.
Insulin: This column contains the 2-hour serum insulin levels, which can help assess insulin resistance or production in the patient.
BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI is a measure of body fat based on a patient's weight and height. It is calculated using the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/mÂ²).
Diabetes Pedigree Function: This is a function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history. It provides a measure of the genetic influence on diabetes risk.
Age: This column records the patient's age in years. Age can be an important factor in understanding diabetes risk as it tends to increase with age.
Outcome: The "Outcome" column is a class variable with two values:
       0: This indicates the absence of diabetes in the patient.
       1: This indicates the presence of diabetes in the patient.


**Objectifs**
The primary aim of this dataset is to use diagnostic measurements included in it to predict, with a diagnostic approach, whether a patient has diabetes or not.
